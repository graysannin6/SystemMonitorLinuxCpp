System Monitor

Udacity Linux Workspace
Udacity provides a browser-based Linux Workspace for students.

You are welcome to develop this project on your local machine, and you are not required to use the Udacity Workspace. However, the Workspace provides a convenient and consistent Linux development environment we encourage you to try.

ncurses
ncurses is a library that facilitates text-based graphical output in the terminal. This project relies on ncurses for display output.

Within the Udacity Workspace, .student_bashrc automatically installs ncurses every time you launch the Workspace.

If you are not using the Workspace, install ncurses within your own Linux environment: sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

Make
This project uses Make. The Makefile has four targets:

build compiles the source code and generates an executable
format applies ClangFormat to style the source code
debug compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
clean deletes the build/ directory, including all of the build artifacts
Instructions
Clone the project repository: git clone https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor-Project-Updated.git

Build the project: make build

Run the resulting executable: ./build/monitor Starting System Monitor

Follow along with the lesson.

Implement the System, Process, and Processor classes, as well as functions within the LinuxParser namespace.

Submit!
